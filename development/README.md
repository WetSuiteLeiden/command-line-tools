These are command lines tools, things that came in handy during debug and data collection.

## dataset-upload
Mostly a single rsync command to save some typing, and to bandwidth-limit.

## dataset-genmeta
Automatically generates the index file that the library's dataset module will read.
Meant to be run on the server that hosts the dataset scripts.
